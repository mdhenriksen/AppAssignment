# AppAssignment
This project includes a Python REST API using the Flask framework and a React frontend. The project is a database of companies and supports the functionality to list, create, update, see details and add benificial owners to the companies. The data is kept in a PostgreSQL database hosted at <a href="https://www.elephantsql.com/">ElephantSQL</a>. 

## Usage
The frontend and backend is hosted in two seperate docker containers on Heroku at the below URLs. Both ``Dockerfiles`` can be found on the GitHub in ``/Frontend`` and ``/API``. The frontend supports all the functionality, but the API can also be accessed via cURL:
* Frontend: https://appassign.herokuapp.com/
* Backend: https://bindapi.herokuapp.com/

## Heroku dynos
When accessing the services the first time, there might be a delay or Heroku error. This is due to the fact that the Heroku dynos that are hosting the system are free, which means that they will sleep when not in use and have to start up if they haven't been used in a while. 

## cURL
The backend supports curl at the following endpoints:
* https://bindapi.herokuapp.com/get (GET: List of companies)
* https://bindapi.herokuapp.com/create (POST: Company)
* https://bindapi.herokuapp.com/details/[ID] (GET: details about specific company)
* https://bindapi.herokuapp.com/owner/[ID] (POST: Owner to specific company)
* https://bindapi.herokuapp.com/update/[ID] (PUT: Company with the company id)

### cURL format
The curl takes JSON formatted data. The owners can't be accessed by cURL or the frontend, but are stored in the database with a reference to the company they belong to.

**Company**

```
{
"id": "",
"name": "",
"address": "",
"city": "",
"country": "",
"mail": "",
"phone": ""
}
```
Note: The company ID is generated in the API, so the "id" field can be left empty. Any value added to the ID will not be used. This is due to the backend requiring an "id" field in the JSON body or it throws an error. This could/should be changed by removing the need for an ID field in the JSON.

**Owner**

```
{
"id": "",
"name": ""
}
```
Note: The frontend gets the ID from the URL however like above, the API expects an ID field in the JSON body for the same reason as with "company".

## SQL Tables
**Companies**
```
CREATE TABLE companies(
   id int PRIMARY KEY,
   name VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
   address VARCHAR (100) NOT NULL,
   city VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
   country VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
   mail VARCHAR(50),
   phone int
);
```
**Owners**
```
CREATE TABLE owners (
   company_id INT references companies(id),
   owner VARCHAR(50));
```
## Considerations
### Authentication
The application does currently not have any authentication. If authentication should be added I would use JWT (JSON Web Tokens). It's relatively small in size and secure (even though a JWT is encoded not encrypted). Also, most programming languages have JSON parsers which make working with it easier and it scales well.
### Making the application redundant
The software could be made redundant by making micro-services of each functionality in the system and running multiple instances of each service and set it up in e.g. a Docker Swarm. This way load balancing can be implemented and in case of faults/errors another instance of the service will take over. This increases the availability and fault tolerance.
### Data versioning
The database currently does not have data versioning. One way it can be achieved is by creating a revision table in the database and adding triggers to the main table. Changes to the main table would then be added to the revision table along with a foreign key and a timestamp.
